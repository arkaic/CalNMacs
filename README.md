# My Personal Calorie Tracker Android App
[Currently in progress]

The aim for this app is a learning exercise in Android, as it's my first time.

Also, I wanted calorie tracking to be as simple as possible. I didn't like the bloated, feature-rich apps that's in the store, so I wanted to make an app that just tracks your calories, the macros, and included an editable database. 

The food database will not be [necessarily] based on any public databases out there, but a personal one that the user should be able to add to, delete from, and edit. If you're like me, on a day to day basis, I eat generally the same types of foods, so having a database of commonly eaten foods instead of an all encompassing list is much more manageable.

Life is complex and I prefer not to add too much more to it, so simply keeping track of the calorie count and the three macros is sufficient for me.
