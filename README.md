# My Personal Calorie Tracker Android App
Currently in progress

The aim for this app is just to be as simple as possible. I didn't like the bloated, feature-rich apps that can be found all over the store, so I wanted to make an app that just tracks your calories, the macros, and included an editable database. 

Life is complex and I prefer not to add too much more to it, so simply keeping track of the calorie count and the three macros is sufficient for me. Also, the food database will not be necessarily based on any of the food databases out there. It'll just have my most commonly eaten foods, so I would have to supply the relevant data.
