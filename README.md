# My Personal Calorie Tracker Android App

##AIM

Also, I wanted calorie tracking to be as simple as possible. I didn't like the bloated, feature-rich apps that's in the store, so I wanted to make a minimalistic app that just tracks your calories, the macros, and included an editable database. 

The food database will not be [necessarily] based on any public databases out there, but a personal one that the user will be able to add to, delete from, and edit. If you're like me, on a day to day basis, I eat generally the same types of foods, so having a database of commonly eaten foods instead of an all encompassing list is much more manageable.


## Progress: All basic features I wanted are implemented

## Features and Layout
The app has two pages you can swipe to choose.

The left page (main page) has your foods eaten, where you can manage the foods you have eaten for the day. This should be saved between app suspensions/pauses/closures until you hit the TRASH button. 

Foods will only have carb, fat, protein, and calorie counts. When choosing foods, you just need to choose the amount you have eaten.

The right page displays all foods in the database that you can add, remove, or edit.

I will prepopulate the database with my own foods for now, but in the future, I may have the app start off with an empty database and allow the user the ability to populate it with a preexisting csv file. Or some other easier means.

## FUTURE FEATURES
* Ability switch unit types for foods in the foods eaten list.
* A sidepage which displays your target calories for the day and the current deficit or surplus.
